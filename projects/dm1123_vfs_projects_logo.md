## PROJECT: LOGO
Create a logo for your selected brand in Adobe Illustrator.

####Decide on your Brand, Organization, Company, etc.
* Select a brand that is personal to you in some way. 
* It could be your own, a friend’s, or a family member’s. 
* Throughout the semester, we’ll be investigating ways to visually communicate this brand, through creating an identity system which will consist of a logo, an interface, and a physical application.
* write a few sentences describing the brand/organization/company, things like its name (does it go by an abbreviation, like NYU?), what it does, who its audience is, etc. Feel free to bring in more than one brand if you're not sure.

####LOGO 1st Draft  
* Post to your wordpress 
* as a gallery 
  * New Post -> Add Media -> Create Gallery
  * (OPTIONAL NOT REQUIRED)lightbox functionality via wordpress lightbox plugin of your choice
* Category: logo1
* Add the name of your personal brand, along with a very brief description (1 to 2 sentences max) of what your logo is for to your wordpress post
* **At least 10 different versions of logo** iterations of your selected brand **ALL in grayscale (this includes black &amp; white)**
* One logo per 8 1/2 x 11 (letter) dimensions for a total of at least 20 images
  * A big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner
* at least 3 should be digital
* at least 3 should be haptic (non-digital) 
  * You will need to digitize haptic files (i.e. scan or take a digital photo, etc.)
* Also, consider creating haptic / digital combos
* To comprise your different versions, play around with creating <a href="http://www.logodesignsource.com/types.html" target="_blank">icons/symbols, logotypes, and/or combination logos</a>
* It could also be a redesign of an existing personal logo. If so, please post the original logo as well
