## TICKETS TO LEAVE


Each class period, before you leave write **your name and date** on a new document and answer both of the following questions:

* What are the three most important points you learned today in class?
* What concept(s) confuses you from today’s lecture or exercises? (This will give you a clue as to what you should study before the next class.)

* VERY IMPORTANT: name your ticket to leave documents with your last name, then first name, then reading. 
	* For example: _Seegers, Jesse - Sept 9 ticket to leave.doc_
