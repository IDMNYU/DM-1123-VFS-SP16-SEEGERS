## PROJECT: INTERFACE
Using a combination of Illustrator and/or Photoshop, apply your brand to a digital interface of your choice (game, website, mobile application, etc).

#### INTERFACE Wireframes    
Post on your class website in grayscale (includes black and white) with interface-wireframes category. 

* Create a wireframe of your interface in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11). 
  * If you are doing a website, you also need to include a sitemap in grayscale (includes black and white) with interface-wireframes category. 
* Every single element needs to be accounted for including controls, text, images, videos, and supporting graphics. 
* Do not use Lorem Ipsum for text. Use Real Text.

#### INTERFACE High-Fidelity Wireframes  
* Create 3 different versions of your interface as high fidelity wireframes in color
* Post on your class website with an inteface-hifi-wireframe

#### INTERFACE Final: High-Fidelity Prototype 
* Refine selection
* Post a clickable prototype on your class website with an inteface-final category (or on basecamp. If you post on basecamp, link to your basecamp message from wordpress).
  * Consult the readings and/or VFS <a href="../dm1123_vfs_recommended_resources.md">resources</a> page for applications to use for prototypes.
